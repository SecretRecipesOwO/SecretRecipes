    <p><strong>Sheets &ndash; 1h</strong></p>
    <p>1.1. Put the eggs, sugar, milk, and the oil and whisk until everything is mixed well, beat the mixture with the whisk until the sugar is thoroughly combined.</p>
    <p>1.2. Add the salt and continue to mix it.</p>
    <p>1.3. Mix the bicarb soda and the lemon juice separately before adding it to the other ingredients, before mixing very slightly, don&rsquo;t mix it in much though.</p>
    <p>1.4. Add one spoonful of flour at a time, mixing it by hand to prevent overmixing.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1.5. Begin to knead the dough until it is a homogenous dough, make sure it&rsquo;s not too solid or too soft.</p>
    <p>1.6. Divide the dough into three pieces, and make them as even as possible.</p>
    <p>1.7. Take one of the three dough balls and place it on a piece of baking paper before flattening it into the desired size.</p>
    <p>1.8. Place the baking paper onto a rectangular tray and gently stab a fork into the dough to aerate it before baking.</p>
    <p>1.9. Bake the 3 sheets for 15 minutes at 180&deg;C Fan forced (200&deg;C) until they are faintly white on top with golden brown at the edges.</p>
    <p><strong>Cream &ndash; 40m</strong></p>
    <p>2.1. In a saucepan, add the flour, sugar, and lemon rinds and whisk it in slightly.</p>
    <p>2.2. Little by little, add the milk and whisk it in and combine thoroughly. Once there are no more clumps left in the mixture, add the rest of the milk.</p>
    <p>2.3. After it&rsquo;s all mixed well, add the vanilla essence and a small bit of lemon juice.</p>
    <p>2.4. Mix it well before putting the pot on the stove and continuing to whisk until the cream starts to thicken.</p>
    <p>2.5. After the cream has thickened, leave it on low heat on the stovetop for 15 minutes.</p>
    <p>2.6. Take it off the heat and add the rest of the lemon juice.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Note: If the cream doesn&rsquo;t thicken well, mix cold water and 2 tbsp of flour, before adding it to the cream and leaving it for another 5 minutes.</em></strong></p>
    <p>2.7. Once the cream has cooled to room temperature, put it into a stand mixer and add 2 tbsp of butter. Mix the butter in before adding another 2 tbsp. Repeat until all the butter is gone.</p>
    <p>2.8. Once the cream is ready, put the solid layers into a (preferably glass) tin, before pouring in around half of the cream.</p>
    <p>2.9. Once half the cream is added, mix in a small amount of desiccated coconut.</p>
    <p>2.10. Add the second solid layer before adding the other half of cream and mixing in another small amount of desiccated coconut.</p>
    <p>2.11. Add the third solid layer and put into the fridge for 4-5 hours to cool and set.</p>
