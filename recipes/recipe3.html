<p><strong>Ingredients (makes 1, 8 inch cake):</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cake - 8 ingredients</strong></p>
<p>3⁄2 cups of flour (180g)</p>
<p>3⁄2 cups of oatmeal (120g)</p>
<p>3⁄2 cups of desiccated coconut (128g)</p>
<p>9⁄8 cups of raw sugar (225g)</p>
<p>1 tsp baking powder</p>
<p>1 tsp baking soda</p>
<p>2 eggs (100-110g)</p>
<p>190g of softened butter</p>
<p><strong>Filling - 1 ingredient</strong></p>
<p>1 jar of fruit jam OR ALTERNATIVELY 225g of Berry preserves</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Instructions &ndash; 1h</strong></p>
<p><strong>The cake (bottom layer) &ndash; 40m</strong></p>
<p>1.1. Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C (180&deg;C fan forced) and grease a cake tin.</p>
<p>1.2. Put every ingredient except for the filling inside a stand mixer and mix until you have a cohesive dough.</p>
<p>1.3. Take two thirds of the dough and press it evenly into the bottom and walls of the cake tin.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note: Make sure that it&rsquo;s around 2cm (&frac34; of an inch) thick, not too thin but not too thick that it cooks unevenly.</em></strong></p>
<p>1.4. Once it&rsquo;s evenly spread out around the cake tin, add the filling in and evenly spread it around.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note: Sometimes one jar isn&rsquo;t enough and you may need to add another half a jar, but don&rsquo;t add too much extra.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The top layer &ndash; 20m</strong></p>
<p>2.1. Once the filling is evenly spread out, take the other third of dough and turn them into various thin rolls.</p>
<p>2.2. After you have the thin rolls, lay them out above the cake in your desired pattern.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note: The thin rolls are very fragile and easily break</em></strong></p>
<p>2.3. Gently merge the edges with the dough pressed against the walls of the cake tin.</p>
<p>2.4. Once you have all the rolls gently fused into the edges, place into the oven for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown.</p>
