        1.4: Shape the dough into a rectangle (roughly 2-3cm high) before wrapping in clear wrap and chilling until firm.<br>
        <strong><em>Note: The dough can be made well in advance, being able to last almost a month when frozen.</em></strong><br>
        1.5: Preheat oven to 175-180&deg;C.<br>
        1.6: Cut the rectangle into strips about 1.5cm thick.<br>
        1.7: Place slices far apart on a baking tray (they expand a lot) and use a fork/skewer to aerate the cookies.<br>
        1.8: Let the cookies cook for 10 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through.<br>
        1.9: Let the cookies cool on some form of wire rack.<br>
