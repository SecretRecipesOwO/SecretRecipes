    <p><strong>Tin size &mdash; 8 inches round (you will need 2)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Instructions &mdash; 8h10m (including solidification process) &mdash; 19 steps&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Vanilla pastry cream &mdash; 30m</strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Note: needs time to cool before preparing filling, so do this first</em></strong></p>
    <p>1.1: Place milk in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer (79&deg;C to 82&deg;C)</p>
    <p>1.2: Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and salt until combined well. Add flour and cornstarch and mix to combine.</p>
    <p>1.3: Take milk off heat, gradually add it to the egg mixture, and then return to heat, stirring until it boils and thickens.</p>
    <p>1.4: Remove from head and add vanilla extract.</p>
    <p>1.5: Pour the cream into a clean bowl (preferably glass), covering with plastic wrap. Press the plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent forming a skin and allow it to cool until room temperature.</p>
    <p><strong>Almond flakes &mdash; 10m</strong></p>
    <p>2.1: Toast the almond flakes in a pan, stirring constantly, after turning slightly golden brown, take off heat and set aside until used.</p>
    <p><strong>Cake layers with meringue &mdash; 1h10m</strong></p>
    <p>3.1: Preheat the oven to 165&deg;C and grease the bottoms and sides of two 8 inch pans, lining them with parchment paper afterwards.</p>
    <p>3.2: Seperate 3 egg whites from yolks. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until creamy, after which, incorporate the yolks one at a time.</p>
    <p>3.3: Sift flour, baking powder, and salt, gently assimilating it into the butter mixture.</p>
    <p>3.4: Divide the batter evenly into the prepared pans and set aside.</p>
    <p>3.5: In a large bowl, whip egg whites with salt until foamy, add lemon juice. Gradually add sugar and continue mixing until stiff peaks form.</p>
    <p>3.6: Divide meringue on top of cake batter and spread evenly, sprinkling the top with the toasted almonds.</p>
    <p>3.7: Bake for 22-28 minutes until golden brown.</p>
    <p><strong>Vanilla filling &mdash; 20m</strong></p>
    <p>4.1: Dissolve gelatin in cold water and soak for 5-10 minutes. Dissolve over low heat and pour over vanilla pastry cream, mix to combine.</p>
    <p>4.2: In a medium bowl, mix whipping cream until stiff peaks form, gently incorporating into the pastry cream mixture.</p>
    <p><strong>Cake assembly &mdash; 4-8h</strong></p>
    <p>5.1: Turn one of the meringue bases onto a serving platter so the meringue is facing upside-down. Place a cake ring around it and line with a sheet (most preferably acetate).</p>
    <p>5.2: Pour filling over the cake and smooth the top. Add the second layer of meringue facing up.</p>
    <p>5.3: Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours, or even overnight.</p>
